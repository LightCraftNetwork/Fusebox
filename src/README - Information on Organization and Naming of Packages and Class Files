== Information on Organization and Naming of Packages and Class Files ==

General Reasoning:
	This file exists for one purpose.
	This files purpose is to provide rules and regulation regarding the organization of classes and packages within this jar.
	By this point, anyone reading this should have noticed that this project is remarkably unorganized.
	(To the point that it is nearly impossible to location any files intuitively or to know that you are properly accessing another developrer's file appropriately.
	In order to address all these issues, it should be noted that all developers (myself included) should begin to follow these rules and regulations
	as well as take the initiative to bring any past packages and class files in-line with these rules.
	By doing this, the project will begin to be much more organized and become MUCH easier to develop within as it will have an intuitive mode of
	locating and utilizing all of the resources that it has availiable without the resources being limited to a single method, class, package, or other form of unnecessary container.
