/*
 * It should go without saying that that this package is to be used for all
 * files DIRECTLY related to mini-games. This does NOT. however, make it okay to
 * add Utility files, files that can be used by other parts of the plugin (eg
 * core files), files interacting with events that impact more than just the
 * mini-game(s), or files that have minimal to no connection with mini-games. By
 * this point we should all have become aware of exactly how horendously
 * organized this jar file is and we should be taking steps to organize it
 * significantly.
